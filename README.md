## About

Python webpage for use on `http://bbs.kyau.net/`. This is a resurrected version
of the original BBS webpage that has been modified to fit the times.

The accompanying python shell script is a telnet bot used to feed MajorMUD 
information into the SQL database. You will need Python 2.x and MySQL-python
in order to get the bot working.
